### Our Inspiration 💬

We draw motivation from the wisdom found in Gurbani:

#### Guru Gobind Singh Ji:
> "hi(n)dhoo turak kouoo raafajee imaam saafee maanas kee jaat sabai ekai pahichaanabo ||"
> Someone is Hindu and someone a Muslim, then someone is Shia, and someone a Sunni, but all human beings, as a species, are recognized as one and the same.

#### Guru Arjan Dev Ji:
> "jithai jai baheeaai bhalaa kaheeaai jhol a(n)mrit peejai ||"
> Let us speak of goodness, wherever we go and sit; let us skim off the Ambrosial Nectar and drink it in.
> "gunaa kaa hovai vaasulaa kadd vaas lieejai ||3||"
> One who has a basket of fragrant virtues should enjoy its fragrance.
